                <h5>This page has a mission to raise awareness
                about the importance of maintaining balance with our
                non-human neighbors. While New York City is globally
                renowned for its cultural diversity, what often goes
                unnoticed is the rich diversity of flora and fauna
                that we coexist with in this urban landscape.
                This webpage is a work in progress, and I assure you that
                I'll continuously enhance the design and expand the database.
                Take a look at the menu and delve into the vibrant and varied
                world of animals, fish, birds, and trees that share this
                incredible city with us humans.</h5>
