        <h1>Hello fellow New Yorkers
            and everyone else interested in our
            great and diverse city! </h1>
        <h5>Welcome to this page with a mission to raise awareness
            about the importance of maintaining balance with our
            non-human neighbors. While New York City is globally
            renowned for its cultural diversity, what often goes
            unnoticed is the rich diversity of flora and fauna
            that we coexist with in this urban landscape.
            This webpage is a work in progress, and I assure you that
            I'll continuously enhance the design and expand the database.
            Take a look at the menu and delve into the vibrant and varied
            world of animals, fish, birds, and trees that share this
            incredible city with us humans.</h5>
